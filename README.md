Welcome to Fatiu Online Bookstore, a C# console application that I developed as both a passion project and a learning experience in software development. This platform is designed for book lovers and aspiring developers alike.

The idea behind this project came from my love for reading and my desire to create something practical. I wanted to build a user-friendly environment where you can register, log in, browse a diverse catalog of books, and manage your shopping experience seamlessly. Each book comes with essential details like titles, authors, prices, and stock availability, encouraging you to discover new stories and authors.

One of the highlights of the application is the shopping cart feature. It allows you to easily select books for purchase and provides a straightforward checkout process. You can calculate total costs, manage stock levels, and experience the essence of online shoppingâ€”all in one place!

This project is not just about code; it's about learning and growth. I focused on writing clean, maintainable code, simulating a database with in-memory data structures, and enhancing my understanding of data management in programming.

As you explore the Fatiu Online Bookstore, I hope you find inspiration and opportunities for enhancements. Feel free to fork the repository and add your features or share your feedback! Together, we can make this project even better.

Thank you for checking out my project, and I hope you enjoy your journey through the world of books!
